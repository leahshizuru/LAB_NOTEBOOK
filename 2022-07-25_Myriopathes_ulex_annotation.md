# Annotating *Myriopathes ulex*

Objective: Re-visit *Myriopathes ulex* annotations. We received feedback from GenBank saying that *ND5* was missing a legal start codon.

Methods:

Map contigs.fasta SPAdes output to *M. japonica* in Geneious Prime. In our previous iteration the mt genome (NODE_5_length17838_cov_59.388403) was edited (repeat sequences at the start and end of the linear sequence removed) and the linear sequence was then circularized. Annotations were transferred from *M. japonica* onto the circularized sequence. Our initial mt genome submission (2022-07-21) (ID: 2605514) was 17,711 bp.
