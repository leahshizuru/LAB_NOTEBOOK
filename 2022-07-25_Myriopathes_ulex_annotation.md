## Annotating *Myriopathes ulex*

Objective: Re-visit *Myriopathes ulex* annotations. We received feedback from GenBank saying that *ND5* was missing a legal start codon.

Map contigs.fasta SPAdes output to *M. japonica* in Geneious. In our previous iteration we edited and then circularized NODE_5_length17838_cov_59.388403. Our initial mt genome submission (2022-07-21) (ID: 2605514) was 17711 bp.
