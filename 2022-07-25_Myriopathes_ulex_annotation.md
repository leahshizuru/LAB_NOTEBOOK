# Annotating *Myriopathes ulex*

**Objective:** Re-visit *Myriopathes ulex* annotations. We received feedback from GenBank saying that *ND5* was missing a legal start codon.

**Methods:** The mitogenome we submitted to GenBank (NODE_5_length17838_cov_59.388403 from SPAdes assembly) was edited (repeat sequences at the start and end of the linear sequence removed) and then circularized. Annotations were then transferred from *M. japonica* onto the circularized sequence. This mitogenome submission (2022-07-21) (ID: 2605514) was 17,711 bp. See below.

Mapped contigs.fasta file that SPAdes generated to *M. japonica* in Geneious Prime. Performed BLAST on consensus sequence (17,758 bp) that was created. BLAST results revealed M. ulex to be more identical to *Tanacetipathes thamnea* (JX45649.1) (Per. Ident: 99.52%) than to *Myriopathes japonica* (NC_046843.1) (Per. Ident: 98.68%).
