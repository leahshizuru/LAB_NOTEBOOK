# Annotating *Antipathes grandis* 

**Objective:** Annotate *Antipathes grandis* (red polyps)(187-W-Maui) collected in the Au'Au Channel.

**Methods:**

1. Inspect large_contigs_187.fasta produced by SPAdes.
2. Select best candidate for downstream analysis (NODE_1_length_20611_cov_7.376538) and BLAST this node.
3. BLAST results revealed 99% Query Cover and 99.76%, 98.99% Per. Identity for Stichopathes sp. SCBUCN-8850 and Stichopathes sp. SCBUCN-8849, respectively.
4. Download relevant *A. grandis* material from GenBank; place these files into the "Reference Features" subfolder labeled "antipatharians".
5. In Geneious Prime: "Find Repeats", remove the duplicated repeat at the and end of the sequence then "Circularize Sequence."
6. Transfer annotations from database. (See Figure 1)
7. Create two working iterations, one specifically to compare annotations for COX3, COX1, tRNA & ND2 among color morphs. This second iteration was a 100% match to (GU296499 and GU296487) the red morphotype.
