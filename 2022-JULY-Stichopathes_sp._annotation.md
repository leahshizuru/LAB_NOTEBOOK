# Annotating *Stichopathes* sp

**Objective:** Annotate *Stichopathes* sp. (180-W-Kaua) collected at Amber's Arches off of Kauai.

**Methods:**

1. BLAST contigs.fasta from SPAdes output.
2. Select best candidate for downstream analysis (NODE_39_length_20586_cov_107.795298).
3. The following steps were executed in Geneious Prime:
4. "Find Repeats", remove the duplicated repeat* at the and end of the sequence then "Circularize Sequence."
5. The 127 bp repeat was inspected and per the author's discretion 126/127 bp were removed. This was to ensure that the mt genome maintained the correct amount of bases for the reading frame.
6. Annotations were transferred from database.
7. Annotations revealed a reverse compliment was needed so "Reverse Compliment" in the "Sequence" tab was selected.

Final annotation is as follows:
